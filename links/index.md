[Sage](http://sagemath.org) is an open source mathematical project using [Python](http://python.org) that I have used several times in my research.

[Ravi Vakil's book](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/index.html) about algebraic geometry was very influential on me as I was trying to get into the subject.

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is nice if you need to quickly evaluate an integral or something.

[Macaulay2](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/) is a computer system for doing computational algebraic geometry that has been useful to me.

I am on [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/) and [Math Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/).
